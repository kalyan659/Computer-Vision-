# Tesseract OCR Speed Up  
Supercharge Your OCR PDF to text Conversions with Multithreaded OCR!

Tired of slow document processing in CPU? 

Say hello to this blazing-fast OCR project powered by Tesseract and the magic of multiprocessing!

## Why we did it
Tesseract overall accuracy is better than many free OCR engine. 

However, it does not support GPU for speedup. 

Hence, we wanted to speed up by using power of exsisting  core of CPU and we find it much faster.

## Features:
Turbocharged Conversions: Leverage the power of parallel processing to convert PDFs to text at record speeds.

Tesseract Accuracy: Extract text with confidence, thanks to Tesseract's robust OCR engine.

Versatility Unchained: Tackle any multipage PDF formats without breaking a sweat.

Speed: Average 2-3 second per page using i7 12 core PC.

## How It Works:
Load Your Docs: Simply select a pdf file and thats it

## Limitation:
Only one pdf file at a time

# Future 
Can be upgraded to support multiple pdf file selection at one time.
Can be integrated to support Image file to text.
